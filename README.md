🧠 Simon Game – JavaScript

Description (Resume / Portfolio):
Developed an interactive Simon memory game using vanilla JavaScript, implementing dynamic sequence generation, user input validation, and game-state management. The game replays the full system-generated sequence at every level and adds progressive difficulty. Enhanced user experience with DOM-based animations, keyboard event handling, and audio feedback for correct and incorrect actions. Designed a responsive and visually engaging interface with clean UI styling.
